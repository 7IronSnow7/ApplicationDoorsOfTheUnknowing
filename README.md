Text-Based Game Project
Welcome to the Text-Based Game project! We've created an exciting game, but as you'll notice, there's room for improvement in the codebase. We invite you to contribute by creating reusable code and cleaning up the existing code.

How to Contribute
1. Review the Code
Take some time to explore the codebase and identify areas where there is repetition, code that can be made more efficient, or opportunities to create reusable components.

2. Fork the Repository
To start contributing, fork this repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project that you can freely modify.

3. Make Changes
Implement improvements in your forked repository. Focus on cleaning up repetitive code, optimizing algorithms, and creating reusable functions or classes.

4. Commit and Push
Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. Push your changes to your forked repository.

5. Create a Pull Request
Open a Pull Request (PR) from your forked repository to this main repository. Describe the changes you've made and how they enhance the codebase. We'll review your PR and provide feedback.

Contribution Guidelines
Please keep these guidelines in mind when contributing:

Maintain code readability: Ensure that your changes follow the existing coding style and conventions.
Test thoroughly: Test your changes to avoid introducing new issues.
Document your work: If you introduce new functionality or modify existing behavior, provide appropriate documentation.
